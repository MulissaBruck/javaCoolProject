/*Example Comparison
Consider an array: {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}.

j = 0: When i = 2 (with a[i] = 2), youâ€™ll count all occurrences of 2 again from the start of the array.
j = i: When i = 2 (with a[i] = 2), you start counting from index 2, avoiding previous occurrences of 2 
at index 1.
Starting from j = i is often more efficient in frequency-counting problems to avoid redundant counting, 
especially if you only need to count each unique element once. */
